# dotfiles (polydeer)

this is old! i don't use this theme anymore, although my current polybar is basically the same but with tweaked colors. kinda just left it in its own repository so
i remember that i made this one. polydeer is the first theme i ever actually uploaded onto my github. it's not horrible, but i got bored of it quickly. also i switched from kitty to urxvt. it's called polydeer because of the wallpaper (not the actual title of the picture, i just found it off google and started calling it the polydeer). this repo doesn't have a screenshot and won't because i don't feel like reconfiguring my i3 and reinstalling kitty just to take a screenshot.
